inspiration for my beef exam

13
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:17,039
shades was the good girl vibe
and the bad girls vibe everybody
has a little bit of both in them
so i wanted to express that with

21
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,779
these colors one hundred percent
of the proceeds are going to the
MAC AIDS son like every single
penny go to people infected with

29
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:29,430
HIV and AIDS that need medicine

no other brand does that so that
makes it ten thousand times more
exciting to me

39
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,620

83
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,920

and hair and music are all forms
of self-expression
